That Don't Impress Me Much by Shania Twain

I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty [ADJECTIVE]
But you've got being right down to an art
You think you're a genius, you drive me up the wall
You're a regular original, a know-it-all

Oh-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you're a smth scientist

That don't impress me much
So you got the brains, but have you got the smth?
Now, don't get me wrong—yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me idk in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

I never knew a guy who carried a blah in his pocket
And a comb up his sleeve—just in case
And all that extra hold gel in your hair oughta lock it
’Cause heaven forbid it should fall outta place

Oh-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you're idk

That don't impress me much (Oh, oh, uuh)
So you got the looks, but have you got the touch?
Now, don't get me wrong—yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much
Yeah
